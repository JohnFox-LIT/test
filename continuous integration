[//]: # (practice:testing)[//]: # (maturity:adopt)[//]: # (impact:3)[//]: # (difficulty:moderate)# Continuous-IntegrationThe practice of merging development work with a branch multiple times per day to integrate code frequently, test new changes and test that those changes work with other committed changes.Code is tested regularly and early to enable the discovery and fixing of issues as quickly as possible.## DescriptionWhen embarking on a change, a developer takes a copy of the current code base on which to work. As other developers submit changed code to the source code repository, this copy gradually ceases to reflect the repository code. Not only can the existing code base change, but new code can be added as well as new libraries, and other resources that create dependencies, and potential conflicts.When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy.Ensuring developers have the latest code before committing their changes reduces the chances of code conflicts and issues. Using a CI tool (Jenkins, Bamboo) we poll the source control repository with high frequency (e.g. every few mins) to determine if new code changes have been delivered.If new code changes are detected in the repository a job is initiated to pull down the stream/branch to a workspace and execute the automated tests the job has been configured to run.Additional steps in the job may include executing static code analysis e.g. SonarThe final step of the job in most configurations is notifying people if any test(s) failed.  The method of notification is often different (Email, Slack etc) but the intent is the same - to inform those who committed changes to source control during the period of time between the current job and last job that there was a failure which should be fixed as soon as possible. ### GoalCI has two main aimsThe high frequency low volume / early and often approach to integrating development code markedly reduces the instances of code conflicts and 'integration hell'.Executing automated tests numerous times per day enables catching and resolving defects earlier and cheaper.### Smells## ContextTeams can use Continuous Integration to validate changes against elements of their definition of done by ensuring that their code meets criteria such as:The code they write passes a basic level of testingThe code meets a standard level of coding qualityThey are providing unit tests for their new codeContinuous Integration also provides them visibility into their code base byreporting existing deficiencies and opportunity for improvement in the existing code base e.g. report classes which are not currently tested or would benefit from increased quality testingIt should be an environment that promotes the automation of mundane and repetitive developer tasks to improve efficiency and effectiveness of developers. Continuous Integration is a critical component of an automated deployment pipeline.### Experiences### Futher Information* [Martin Fowler on CI](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)* Continuous Delivery (Jez Humble and David Farley)
